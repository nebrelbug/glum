**Summary**

glum is a super lightweight Enum library that makes use of Symbols to achieve type-safety.

_What if my environment doesn't support ES6?_

If you're in a browser, use a polyfill.
If you're running in Node, chances are that Symbols are supported: they're supported in all versions after 5.12.0.

### ðŸŒŸ Features

- Type-safety. When you declare an Enum, members are unique and can't be mimicked by strings, numbers, etc.

### Installation

```
npm install glum
```

Or, if in a browser,

```
<script crossorigin src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/glum"></script>
```

[Note: this will create a global variable called Glum]

### Usage

We distribute a UMD build, so you can use it with ES modules, CommonJS, AMD, or in the browser

```js
import Enum from 'glum'
// or var Enum = require 'glum'

let FRUIT = new Enum('APPLE', 'ORANGE', 'PEAR')

function nameFruit (fruit) {
  if ((fruit = FRUIT.APPLE)) {
    console.log("It's an apple")
  }
}

console.log(FRUIT.getName(FRUIT.APPLE)) // APPLE
```

## :heavy_check_mark: Tests

Tests can be run with `npm test`. Multiple tests check that things return expected results, formatting follows guidelines, and code coverage is at the expected level.
